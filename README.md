- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lin-xun1113
- 👀 I’m interested in creating fun Dapp and auditing smart contract
- 🌱 I’m currently learning further smart contract audit and blockchain architecture 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Dapp development or smart contract audit
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to mail me linxun1113@gamil.com
- 😄 Pronouns: To Code To Build To Imagine
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm still a beginner in the WEB3 field. If you have any good ideas for developing a Dapp, please contact me. I might be able to help you develop it for free. If you have any smart contracts you've developed and want to have them audited, I might also be able to help you with a free audit (depending on my mood and time, hehe). Hope to meet more interesting or practical WEB3 developers! The decentralized future is coming my friends !!
